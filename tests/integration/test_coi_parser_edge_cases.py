Comprehensive COI Parser Edge Case Tests

Tests for the real-world issues that were identified and fixed:
1. Policy numbers that look like years (2025)
2. Insurance company names with "Insurance" in them
3. Currency amounts with M/Million multipliers
4. Various OCR character substitution errors
5. Minimal format documents
